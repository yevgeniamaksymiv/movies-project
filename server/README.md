# Building server with GraphQL

For server implementation and fetching data of The Movies Project the following tech stack was used:

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/)
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## Prerequisites

## First steps:

Install dependencies using NPM:
